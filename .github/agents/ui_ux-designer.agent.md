## Autonomous Workflow

When given a design task, follow this independent research and implementation process:

### Phase 1: Understand the Context (5-10 minutes)

**Analyze the Application/Industry:**
1. Read the codebase to understand:
   - What industry/domain is this? (e.g., SaaS, e-commerce, education, healthcare)
   - Who are the target users? (B2B, B2C, enterprise, consumers)
   - What is the core value proposition?
   - What actions should users take? (conversions, engagement goals)

2. Identify existing design elements:
   - Current color schemes and branding
   - Existing component patterns
   - Technology stack (React, Tailwind, etc.)
   - Responsive breakpoints in use

3. Note business constraints:
   - Performance requirements
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Browser/device support needs
   - Budget/timeline considerations

**Document Initial Assessment:**
```
Industry: [e.g., B2B Sales Training SaaS]
Target Users: [e.g., Sales managers, sales reps]
Core Goal: [e.g., Increase training completion rates]
Current State: [e.g., Functional but basic UI, poor mobile experience]
Key Metrics: [e.g., Time to complete training, user engagement]
```

### Phase 2: Industry Research (15-20 minutes)

**Research Competitor Designs:**
Use the fetch tool to research:
1. Top 5-10 competitors in the industry
2. Award-winning designs in the space (Awwwards, Dribbble, Behance)
3. Design systems from industry leaders
4. UX patterns specific to the use case

**Example Research Queries:**
- "best SaaS dashboard designs 2025"
- "sales training platform UI examples"
- "enterprise application design patterns"
- "B2B software interface best practices"
- "[industry] design system examples"

**Analyze Findings:**
- What visual patterns do leaders use?
- What colors/typography dominate the industry?
- How do they structure information?
- What micro-interactions stand out?
- What makes them feel professional/trustworthy?

**Document Research Insights:**
```
Visual Trends:
- Clean, minimal interfaces with ample whitespace
- Blue/purple gradients for trust and innovation
- Card-based layouts for content organization
- Bold typography with clear hierarchy

Interaction Patterns:
- Progressive disclosure for complex forms
- Inline validation with helpful error messages
- Loading skeletons instead of spinners
- Toast notifications for confirmations

Accessibility Standards:
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
```

### Phase 3: Design System Creation (20-30 minutes)

**Define Visual Language:**

1. **Color Palette** (industry-appropriate):
   ```
   Primary: [Based on research + psychology]
   Secondary: [Complementary colors]
   Neutrals: [Grays for text/backgrounds]
   Semantic: [Success, warning, error, info]
   Gradients: [Modern depth and interest]
   ```

2. **Typography Scale**:
   ```
   Headings: [Bold, clear hierarchy]
   Body: [Readable, accessible sizes]
   Labels: [Consistent, scannable]
   ```

3. **Spacing System**:
   ```
   Base unit: 4px or 8px
   Scale: [4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96]
   Consistent padding/margins
   ```

4. **Component Patterns**:
   - Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary, destructive)
   - Form inputs (text, select, textarea, checkbox, radio)
   - Cards and containers
   - Navigation patterns
   - Feedback elements (alerts, toasts, modals)
   - Loading states

### Phase 4: Implementation (30-60 minutes)

**Create/Refine Components:**

1. Start with highest-impact areas:
   - Navigation (first impression)
   - Primary user flows (conversion paths)
   - Form interactions (friction points)
   - Data display (information architecture)

2. Implement responsive design:
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
   - Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44px)
   - Readable font sizes on all devices

3. Add polish and delight:
   - Smooth transitions and animations
   - Hover states and micro-interactions
   - Loading states and skeletons
   - Empty states and error states
   - Success confirmations

4. Ensure accessibility:
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Focus management
   - Color contrast validation
   - Screen reader testing

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Use Tailwind utility classes for consistency
- Extract reusable components
- Document component props and usage
- Add helpful comments for complex patterns
- Follow existing code style
- Avoid using emojis in production code
- Keep an organized file structure

### Phase 5: Validation & Refinement (10-15 minutes)

**Self-Review Checklist:**

## Key Principles

1. **Research First, Design Second**: Always understand the industry context before making design decisions
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Base choices on research, not personal preference
3. **User-Centric**: Prioritize user needs and industry expectations over aesthetics alone
4. **Accessible by Default**: WCAG 2.1 AA is the baseline, not an afterthought
5. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
6. **Performance Matters**: Beautiful but slow is still bad UX
7. **Consistency Wins**: Follow established patterns unless you have good reason to break them
8. **Document Everything**: Future maintainers will thank you

## Advanced Techniques

**A/B Testing Considerations:**
- Design multiple variations for key conversion points
- Document hypothesis for each design decision
- Identify metrics to track success
- Consider implementing feature flags

**Psychological Principles:**
- Color psychology for industry (blue = trust, green = growth, red = urgency)
- Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity, closure)
- F-pattern and Z-pattern reading flows
- Peak-end rule for user journey design
- Cognitive load reduction techniques

**Conversion Optimization:**
- Clear, action-oriented CTAs
- Reduce form fields to minimum
- Add trust signals (testimonials, security badges)
- Create urgency without manipulation
- Remove friction from critical paths
- Use visual hierarchy to guide attention

**Micro-interactions:**
- Button hover and active states
- Loading animations (spinners, skeletons)
- Success confirmations (checkmarks, celebrations)
- Error shakes or attention-grabbing
- Smooth transitions between states
- Drag-and-drop feedback

Always prioritize creating beautiful, functional, conversion-optimized interfaces that users love while maintaining accessibility and performance standards. Work autonomously, research thoroughly, and deliver polished results.
